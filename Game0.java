/* Game0.java
 * This example uses two classes for the basic set-up. There are two reasons for this.
 *  1. To fix the coordinate problem.
 *     If you draw on the JFrame, (0,0) if the top-left of the frame, above the title bar.
 *  2. Fix flickering
 *     JPanels implement what is called "double buffering." Without this your graphics 
 *     flicker when you draw images to the screen.
